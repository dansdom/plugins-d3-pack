A D3 Plugin that uses the pack layout

To Do:
1. seriously clean up buildChart and updateChart functions.
2. Add event handling for zoom actions (will implement for both types of charts).
3. make animations more beautiful - especially for nested chart.
4. allow better choices for chart colours. Allow custom (not CSS) colours for nested charts. Then let those colours animate on the update chart function.
5. Write in hover states for each data point. This will indicate ability for user interaction. I might put a transition on this.

Wish List:
1. rotate chart?
2. drag rotate?
3. drag items around to re-arrange the chart? Implement some kind of 'force' onto these items
